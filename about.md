This project is my trying to build automatic antenna tracker for UAV with MAVLink telemetry.
Main difference that i use two NEMA-17 steppers instead of servos for rotation.
Also it intended for digital telemetry and video (WiFi).

Now work in progress, first prototype almost done. Now i'am writing software.
