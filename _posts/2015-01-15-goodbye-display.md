I brings to work SSD1306 display to work, but unfortunately it
affects steppers.
So i decided to remove it for now :(.

As notes, i used [U8glib][u8g] for this work.
All sources left in [0.1.1][v011].


[u8g]: https://code.google.com/p/u8glib/
[v011]: https://github.com/X-AT/x-at-arduino/tree/xat-fw-0.1.1
